# Basic SDK Hello World program for Sifteo Cubes

This example for Sifteo Cubes was created following the tutorial from Sean Voisen 
http://sean.voisen.org/blog/2011/10/up-and-running-with-sifteo-sdk/

This example works on the Siftulator but created the repository so someone can show me how to produce the **.elf** file so I can do a *SWISS* install to the Sifteo Base. It currently runs fine on the *Siftulator*. Nevertheless, I can not install it on the Sifteo Cube Base.

I am using second generation Sifteo Cubes.
