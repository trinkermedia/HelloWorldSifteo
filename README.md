Basic SDK Hello World program for Sifteo Cubes

This example for Sifteo Cubes was created following the tutorial from Sean Voisen 
http://sean.voisen.org/blog/2011/10/up-and-running-with-sifteo-sdk/

This example works on the Siftulator but created the repository so someone can show me how to produce the .elf file so I can do a SWISS install to the Sifteo Base. 

I am using V2 of the Sifteo Cbes.
